## Tests

This project includes tests to ensure the correctness and functionality of its components. These tests are written using Jest and React Native Testing Library.

### Running Tests
After you run the project localy you can access the tests:
```
npm test
```

I made an example test for the 'WeatherBox' Component:
```
// WeatherBox.test.js
import React from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react-native";
import WeatherBox from "./weatherBox.jsx";

// This test checks if the component renders the props correctly
describe("WeatherBox component", () => {
  test("renders weather information correctly", () => {
    const condition = require("../../assets/Animations/Animation - 1701969736685.json");
    const day = "Monday";
    const degree = 25;

    const { getByText } = render(
      <WeatherBox condition={condition} day={day} degree={degree} />
    );

    expect(getByText(day)).toBeTruthy();
    expect(getByText(`${degree}¬∞`)).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### This test would check if the WeatherBox component, when provided with specific props (condition, day, degree), correctly renders the day and degree values within its content.
